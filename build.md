# [How to build]({{ site.baseurl }}/build)

Open .sln file with monodevelop (or presumably Visual Studio) and build a release as you would.
All dependencies should be gotten automatically, and references are available in the reference directory.

Note: We depend on a custom patched version of xivmoddingframework until this pullrequest is accepted: https://github.com/liinko/xivModdingFramework/pull/15. A precompiled version is available in References
